On August 6th of that year, the bridge was intended to be detonated to slow the advance of German troops during World War I. However, the explosive charge was not powerful enough and the bridge was able to be used again just two days later.\nAfter the war, it became clear that a new bridge needed to be built due to the insufficient clearance of the original bridge and the danger it posed to shipping, especially during high water. In 1928, the bridge was replaced with a steel truss bridge with three spans. The middle span was 65 meters long and the side spans were 38.40 meters long, and the bridge was 17 meters wide. However, this bridge was destroyed by the Belgian army in 1940.\nIt wasn't until 1952 that the current bridge was built. It is again a steel truss bridge, this time built in pre-stressed concrete, and again has three spans. The bridge is decorated with the coat of arms of the city of Liège and is a popular spot for tourists and locals alike to take in the views of the surrounding area."
